[Autoware](https://www.autoware.org) is an "all-in-one" open-source software framework for self-driving vehicles.
The capabilities of Autoware are primarily well-suited for urban cities, but highways, freeways, mountaineous regions, and geofenced areas can be also covered.
Autoware can be used on physical hardware, but we also provide connections to world-class simulators for safe testing, educational use, and experimentation.

If you plan to use Autoware with real vehicles, **please assess risks, formulate a safety plan, and use separate individuals in the role of safety driver and system monitor at all times**.

Autoware provides a rich set of components for building a self-driving vehicle.
These components cover the complete processing pipeline from perception to control.
Autoware also provides integrations with other open-source self-driving software, such as visualisation toolkits and simulators.
See [the wiki Overview page](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/wikis/Overview) for a detailed overview of its capabilities.
<!--- TODO: Update to point to ReadTheDocs when we get some real documentation -->

Autoware is managed by the [Autoware Foundation](https://www.autoware.org), a non-profit entity founded to manage and direct the Autoware project.
The Autoware Foundation is made up of member organisations from the self-driving industry.
